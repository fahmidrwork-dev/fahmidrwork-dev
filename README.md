# 💫 About Me:
🌟 Hi! I’m Fahmi — a passionate game developer from Indonesia who believes games should make people smile and feel something real.  
🎮 Gameplay > graphics — I focus on coding, creative mechanics, and completing small but fun projects.  
🧠 Constantly improving my skills in Unity (2D & 3D), combat mechanics, AI Navigation, looting systems, UI, and more.

## 🧩 Creative Identity
I love creating games with unique twists — from underwater survival RPGs to supermarket sims with live stock prices.  
Deadlines? Themes? Constraints? That’s where I shine.

🏆 Participated in multiple 48-hour game jams  
✨ Clean, polished, and complete — even under pressure
